Prompt: In this lab, you will write a short Java application that uses a loop control structure. Specifically, your application should accomplish the following: <br>
 Create an ArrayList<String> to store the list of ingredient names added by the user. <br>
 Implement the do while loop structure to allow the user to add ingredients until he or she is done. <br>
 Within your loop, add a branch control structure to prompt the user to enter an ingredient or indicate that he or she is finished. <br>
 Use a for loop to iterate through the ingredientList to print the ingredients in the list.
